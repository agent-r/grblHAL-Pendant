# esp-01 web server for grblHAL pendant

This web server application should be uploaded to the esp-01 module before connecting the module to your grblHAL controller.

It creates a serial connection to the grblHAL controller, transfers machine state to the pendant and receives commands from the pendant.

## Note: I recognized that using the esp-01 version is sometimes  unreliable. I clearly recommend using the bluetooth version.
